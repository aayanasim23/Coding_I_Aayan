# Part 2: A broken math problem

# The following lines should take two inputs from the user and convert them to ints
int_1 = int(input('Give me an integer please'))
int_2 = int(input('Give me another integer please'))

#Take the two inputs and perform basic operations on them together
sum = int_1 + int_2
difference = int_1 - int_2
product = int_1 * int_2
quotient = int_1 / int_2

#Print the answer as integers
print(sum)
print (difference)
print(product)
print(quotient)
